While there are an abundance of image editing programs, I've noticed there are significantly fewer image editing programs that allow for the combination of moving gifs into one image. Hopefully, this repository will soon hold a tool based on Processing which will allow a user to import multiple separate gifs, rearrange and transform them inside a pane, and then  export the result as a new gif.
