There are a lot of image editing programs, but I haven't found any which allow for the combination of multiple moving gifs into one image. Hopefully, this repository will soon hold a tool written with Java/Processing which will allow a user to import multiple separate gifs, rearrange and transform them inside a window, and then  export the result as a new gif.
